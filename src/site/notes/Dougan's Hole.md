## Algemene info (Population: ~50)

The Forgotten and Superstitious Village

Dougan’s Hole is the smallest and most remote of the Ten-Towns, situated on the southern edge of Redwaters. The village is isolated, superstitious, and often overlooked by the rest of the Ten-Towns. Its population is made up mostly of families that have lived there for generations, and outsiders are viewed with suspicion. Dougan’s Hole survives primarily on fishing and has little to no contact with the other towns, except through occasional traders.

The town’s speaker is Speaker Edgra Durmoot, a quiet, brooding figure who keeps the town’s affairs to herself and rarely engages with the politics of the wider region.

### Key Features:

- Frozen Shoreline: The village sits right on the edge of the lake, but the frozen conditions make fishing difficult.
