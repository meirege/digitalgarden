## Algemene info
Jorund "Ironfist" Ravenson, the head guard of [[Revel's End\|Revel's End]], is a looming, menacing figure who embodies both the harshness of the prison and the darker sides of those who exploit their power. Standing well over six feet tall, Jorund is a bald, muscular man with a body that looks as though it has been sculpted by the hard labor and grueling conditions of [[Icewind Dale\|Icewind Dale]] itself. His skin is rough, weathered by years in the unforgiving cold, and his sharp, deep-set eyes reflect the predatory cunning of a man who thrives on control and manipulation.

Jorund earned the nickname "Ironfist" not just for his physical prowess but for his iron-fisted rule over the guards under his command. His strength is evident in his broad shoulders and arms, bulging with muscle, and in the way he casually carries his warhammer—a weapon as brutal and unforgiving as its wieler. His bald head gleams with sweat even in the biting cold, and his square jaw is often set in a hard scowl. His body is adorned with scars, some from past battles and others from the more secretive internal struggles within the prison.

### Exploiting His Position

As head guard, Jorund holds immense sway over the daily operations of [[Revel’s End\|Revel’s End]], and he knows exactly how to leverage this power for his personal gain. He is a master manipulator who uses his position not only to get what he wants but to ensure that those who wish to curry favor with him fall into line. Jorund is known for exploiting his subordinates, coercing them into a form of servitude that goes beyond the professional relationships expected within the prison hierarchy. He dangles the promise of easier assignments, warmer shifts, and lighter duties as bait, making it clear that those who please him will avoid the harshest and most dangerous tasks in [[Revel’s End\|Revel’s End]]. Those who defy him, however, find themselves patrolling the most perilous parts of the prison or assigned to the freezing watchtowers where the cold bites deep into their bones.

Jorund’s favoritism and manipulation run deep. He has no problem coercing the younger, more inexperienced guards into doing his bidding. Through veiled threats, smooth lies, and occasional bribes of extra rations or liquor, he convinces many to turn a blind eye to his more unsavory dealings. Those who play along get by with easier shifts, better quarters, and better access to what little comforts can be found in this bleak prison.

### Corruption and Influence

Jorund's exploitation of his power doesn't end with the guards. He has a network of influence that extends even to some of the prisoners, those who are willing to trade information or loyalty in exchange for minor luxuries or protection. He is not above taking bribes or arranging small favors for certain inmates, carefully walking the line between outright corruption and maintaining his facade as a disciplined and competent leader in front of his superiors. Jorund always makes sure he has enough leverage on others to avoid suspicion or retaliation.

He is especially skilled at pressuring other guards into siding with him. He employs subtle tactics, playing off insecurities or the isolation that comes with life in [[Icewind Dale\|Icewind Dale]]. Some of the younger or less seasoned guards find themselves entrapped by his promises. The more seasoned ones know better than to cross him openly, but even they are careful about how much they defy him, knowing that Jorund has eyes and ears everywhere.

In conversations, Jorund speaks with a low, gravelly voice that carries authority, but there's a dangerous edge to his tone, a sense that he is always assessing how much control he has over the people around him. He can be charming when he needs to be, flashing a predatory grin, but beneath that charm lies a ruthless streak. His temper is well-known, and when he feels disrespected or challenged, he responds with a level of violence that reminds everyone why they fear him. His fists have crushed the spirit of more than one guard who thought they could stand up to him.

### Motivations and Personality

Jorund is a man who craves power, but more than that, he craves control—control over his environment, over his peers, and over his enemies. His ambition is unchecked by morals, and he sees every person around him as either a tool to be used or an obstacle to be removed. The cold and isolation of [[Icewind Dale\|Icewind Dale]] suit him perfectly; there’s no place for weakness in this land, and Jorund revels in being the strong man who bends others to his will.

Despite his thuggish nature, Jorund is cunning. He is acutely aware of how far he can push others, especially his superiors. He knows when to keep his head down and when to assert his dominance, and he’s careful to maintain just enough respect from those above him to keep his position secure. However, if the opportunity presented itself, Jorund wouldn’t hesitate to climb higher, using anyone necessary as a stepping stone.

Beneath his brutal exterior lies a deep sense of entitlement. He believes that he has earned his place at the top of the prison’s food chain and that others should naturally fall in line behind him. Jorund has no qualms about forcing guards to "prove their loyalty," often through tasks or favors that degrade them or put them in dangerous situations, just to see if they are truly devoted to his rule.

### Appearance and Demeanor

- Physical Features: Jorund is bald, his head slick and smooth even in the cold. His face is a blocky, stern mask, with heavy brows and a perpetually hard expression. A jagged scar runs down from the corner of his right eye to the middle of his cheek, a remnant from a skirmish long ago.
- Clothing: His uniform is always immaculately kept, but he wears it in a way that emphasizes his bulk and strength, often leaving his sleeves rolled up to show off his muscular arms. His armor, while functional, is polished to a gleam, a statement of both his authority and his vanity.
- Weapons: Jorund carries a warhammer with him at all times, a symbol of his authority as much as a tool of intimidation. The hammer’s handle is wrapped in thick leather, and its head is forged iron, heavy and brutal in its simplicity. He has been known to use it both in and out of combat, settling disputes with a single crushing blow.
