The Town Built on Fishing and Ambition

Targos sits on the western shore of Maer Dualdon, the largest of the three lakes. It boasts a long, curved palisade that protects it from the bitter winds blowing off the tundra. Targos is one of the most aggressive and ambitious of the Ten-Towns, frequently looking to expand its influence over other towns. Its proximity to the lake allows it to thrive on fishing, making it a significant player in the region’s economy.

Targos is led by Speaker Naerth Maxildanarr, a former aristocrat from Luskan with questionable morals and cunning political maneuvers. His ambition and connections have allowed Targos to grow in power, but his methods raise concerns.

### Key Features:

- The Three Flags Sailing: The town’s main tavern, a rough place filled with sailors and fishers.
- Targos Docks: Constantly busy with fishing boats bringing in knucklehead trout, the town’s main source of income.
