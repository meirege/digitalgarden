## Algemene info (Population: ~100)

The Remote and Shady Forest Town

Lonelywood sits near the northern edge of Maer Dualdon and is surrounded by dense forests. Its remote location has made it a haven for outcasts, rogues, and those with a shady past. Lonelywood’s economy is based on fishing and woodcutting, but its residents are a little more self-reliant than in other towns, often preferring to stay out of politics.

The town’s speaker, Speaker Nimsy Huddle, is a kindly halfling with a generous heart. She is well-liked, despite Lonelywood’s reputation for harboring less-than-reputable folk.

### Key Features:

- The Happy Scrimshander: A small shop specializing in scrimshaw (carvings made from the bones of knucklehead trout).
- Lonelywood Forest: Dense and dark, it provides wood for the town but also conceals dangers, including wolves and other creatures.
