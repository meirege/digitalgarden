The Lawless and Ruthless Town

Easthaven is one of the larger and more dangerous towns in Icewind Dale. Located on the southern shore of Lac Dinneshere, Easthaven has a reputation for ruthlessness and lawlessness. Its past is marred by conflict, including pirate activity and a history of violent power struggles. The town’s folk are known for being tough and unscrupulous, but Easthaven also has a fierce independence that has helped it survive.

The speaker of Easthaven is Speaker Danneth Waylen, a practical and hard-bitten man who has kept order in the town with strict laws, including public executions.

### Key Features:

- The White Lady Inn: A well-known establishment named after a local legend of a ghostly woman who haunts the lake.
- Town Hall: The heart of Easthaven’s government, it serves as both a courthouse and a place of executions.
