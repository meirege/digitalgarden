## Algemene info (Population: ~150)

The Smallest and Most Vulnerable Town

Bremen is a small fishing village at the mouth of the Shaengarne River where it flows into Maer Dualdon. With a population of only around 150, it is the smallest and one of the most vulnerable towns in Icewind Dale. Life here is tough, and the town is constantly battling the elements to maintain its fishing operations.

Speaker Dorbulgruf Shalescar, a crotchety old dwarf, leads Bremen. Despite his advanced age, Dorbulgruf is tough as nails and determined to keep the town going, no matter how bad things get.

### Key Features:

- The Grumpy Moose: A quiet tavern, perfect for those who want to avoid the larger, rowdier taverns of the bigger towns.
- Frozen Lakeshore: Fishing from the lake is often disrupted by the ice, but the town has no other option.
