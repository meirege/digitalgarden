## Algemene info (Population: ~150)

The Frozen Cliffside Ruin Town

Caer-Konig is perched on the northern shore of Lac Dinneshere and is known for the ruined castle (the "Caer") that looms over the town. Once a more important settlement, it has fallen into disrepair over the years. The town relies on fishing and serves as a base for adventurers and rangers who explore the wilds to the north.

The town is led by Speaker Trovus, a silver dragonborn who was once a skilled warrior but has since taken to drinking and lacks the discipline he once had. Despite his flaws, Trovus is a good-hearted leader who tries his best to protect the town.

### Key Features:

- The Northern Light: An inn that serves as the town’s main social hub, named after the magical lantern that hangs outside it.
- Ruined Caer: The old fortress that once stood guard over the town, now crumbling and abandoned, though it is said to hide secrets within.
