The Mead-Brewing Town

Good Mead is a small, close-knit community on the western shore of [[Redwaters\|Redwaters]], famous for producing honey wine, or mead, which is exported to the other towns. Surrounded by thick forests that provide the wood for the town’s mead barrels, Good Mead is known for its warm hospitality, but the town has recently suffered a tragedy—their speaker was killed by a giant, leaving them leaderless and vulnerable.

### Key Features:

- Mead Hall: The center of life in Good Mead, where locals gather to drink, share news, and make decisions.
- Redwaters Shore: The lake, frozen over, provides some meager fishing, but the town mostly relies on its mead production to survive.
