## Algemene info (Population: ~100)

The Ominous Stronghold Town

Caer-Dineval is a small town on the western shore of Lac Dinneshere, dominated by the old keep that overlooks it. The keep, known as the Caer, is still inhabited and serves as the seat of the town’s speaker, but there is an eerie air about it. Caer-Dineval has struggled economically, and the townsfolk are suspicious and insular, relying on fishing to survive.

The current speaker is Speaker Crannoc Siever, who has recently fallen ill, leaving much of the town’s day-to-day operations to a group of mysterious "guests" who have taken residence in the keep.

### Key Features:

- The Uphill Climb: A small inn where visitors can get a room, though it’s rarely busy.
- Caer Dineval Keep: The grim and foreboding keep looms over the town, filled with secrets and those who claim to care for the ill speaker.
